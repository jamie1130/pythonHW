    "### Partial Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us give you partial credit! If you're stuck on a problem and just can't get your code to run: \n",
    "\n",
    "First, **breathe**. Then, do any or all of the following: \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Write down everything relevant that you know about the problem, as comments where your code would go. \n",
    "2. If you have non-functioning code that demonstrates some correct ideas, indicate that and keep it (commented out). \n",
    "3. Write down pseudocode (written instructions) outlining your solution approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, even if you can't quite get your code to work, you can still **show us what you know.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All type checking should use `isinstance` rather code of the form `type(x)==list`. If you don't remember how this works, refer to class notes or give it a quick google.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Whenever reasonably possible, for full credit you should use `list comprehensions` rather than modifying / creating items of a list/array one item at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Operations like `x + y` or `2*x` should not modify the original `TwoDArray` instance `x`. This should not be a problem if you're using list comprehensions in those methods. (This rule will make sense after you read the rest of the problem.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can significantly shorten your code by having your methods call other methods. Therefore, in order to receive full credit, you should do this when reasonably possible. In particular, in my solution, the add magic method calls itself in several places. (This is allowable because there are a bunch of if statements.) If you are confused by this last idea, it might help to look at the example of a function calling itself at the bottom of the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. All lines of code should be 80 or fewer characters. You should also check that your code is visible when you print your pdf. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Solutions which do not, for example, use list comprehensions or have methods call other methods when appropriate, will receive partial credit. If you are struggling, a perfectly valid strategy is to first write a down a \"less good\" solution that works, do the rest of the exam, and then try to make your \"less good\" solution into a better solution."

    "\n",
    "__Before we proceed:__ Let's shortly recap two-dimensional arrays and the numpy implementation of them. We can think of two-dimensional arrays as tables of numbers: we refer to them as being two-dimensional because each number in the table has both a row and column index. They are very useful as it is often natural to store data in tabular form. Furthermore matrices, which play a very important role in many areas of Math, Computer Science and Engineering, are also represented using them! Here is an example in numpy."
